        <h3>Become a World's No. 1 Developer </h3>
        <p>There are lots of web developer jobs out there, but I want one where I am going to be challenged and where the skills and qualities that I have built up are going to be put to good use. I carried out lots of research into your organization prior to submitting my resume/CV, and the work you do, the products and services you offer, and the manner in which you support your employees tell me this is a great place to work. I am seeking long-term employment with the same company where I can really immerse myself into their brand and their online ambitions, and this is genuinely the only place I want to work as a Web Developer.</p>
